# ShinyDashboardPortfolio
this repository contains shiny dashboards created in R 
in order to run the dashboard code, you'll need to install R and the necessary packages (listed at the top of the script) and download the dataset (.csv file). I will also be uploading screenshots of dashboards as well.
